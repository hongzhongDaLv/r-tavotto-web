# CLA versioning

> This document is an engineering/licensing artefact, not legal advice.

A signature is consent to **a specific text**. If the text can change underneath
a signature, the record of that signature stops meaning anything — and nothing in
the repository would go red when it happened. This document defines how the two
are kept bound together.

## The invariant

> A signature is bound to the exact bytes of the agreement that was signed, and
> those bytes can never change without a new version.

Concretely: `.github/cla-policy.json` records, for each agreement, the version
string and the SHA-256 of the document. `tests/test_legal_contribution_policy.py`
recomputes both from the files on disk and fails if either has drifted. Editing
a word of `CLA_INDIVIDUAL.md` without updating the policy turns CI red.

## Identity of an agreement

| Field | Where it lives | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Version | `CLA_VERSION:` line in the document, mirrored in `.github/cla-policy.json` | `1.0` |
| Hash | `.github/cla-policy.json` only — never inside the document, which would be circular | `sha256:…` |

The hash is SHA-256 over the raw bytes of the file:

```sh
python3 -c "import hashlib,sys; print(hashlib.sha256(open(sys.argv[1],'rb').read()).hexdigest())" docs/legal/CLA_INDIVIDUAL.md
# or: shasum -a 256 docs/legal/CLA_INDIVIDUAL.md
```

To regenerate every recorded hash after an intentional change:

```sh
python3 scripts/ci/cla_gate.py --refresh-hashes
```

That command **only rewrites the hashes**. It does not bump the version — that
is a decision, and the section below is about who makes it.

## What requires a new version

A **material change** requires a new version string. A material change is any
edit that could alter what a signer is agreeing to:

- anything in the operative `# Agreement` section — definitions, Sections 1–6,
  the signature blocks;
- the identity of the counterparty ("We"/"Us");
- the governing law;
- the outbound-licence option;
- Schedule A's effect on scope in the Corporate CLA.

A **non-material change** may keep the version, but still needs its hash
refreshed and the change recorded below:

- typography, link fixes, Markdown formatting;
- the explanatory sections *outside* `# Agreement` — provenance tables,
  "How to sign", configuration notes.

When the distinction is unclear, treat it as material. The cost of an
unnecessary version bump is asking people to sign again; the cost of a missed one
is a signature that does not cover the text it is recorded against.

## Rules that must not be broken

1. **Existing signatures never migrate.** A ledger entry recorded against
   `1.0` stays against `1.0` forever. Nothing may rewrite old entries to point
   at a new version — not a script, not a bulk edit.
2. **A new version means new consent.** Contributors who signed an earlier
   version have not signed the new one. Whether their earlier signature still
   suffices for a given contribution is a legal judgement about the two texts,
   not something CI decides.
3. **Version strings are append-only.** `1.0` is never reused with different
   bytes. Superseded versions stay in the table below.
4. **`-draft` is not signable.** A version carrying the `-draft` suffix is one
   where `RIGHTS_HOLDER_CONFIGURATION_REQUIRED` is unresolved and the text has
   not been formally activated for signatures. This is about missing details —
   counterparty, contact, governing law — not about any particular legal form
   being required. The gate enforces it structurally: it refuses to let a
   provider be marked as configured while any agreement is still a draft.
   *(No agreement is currently a draft; the rule stands for future revisions.)*

## Where signature records live

**Not in this repository.** The authoritative record of who has signed what is
held by the signature provider (see
[CLA_AUTOMATION_SETUP.md](CLA_AUTOMATION_SETUP.md)). The repository stores the
agreement text, its version and hash, the policy, and the explicit exemptions —
and nothing about individual signers.

An earlier draft of this infrastructure kept a hand-maintained
`docs/legal/cla-signatures.json`. That was removed, because it created **two
sources of truth for the same legal fact**: the provider's database and a file
in the repo. Nothing kept them in step, and once they disagreed there would be
no principled way to say which one governed. A ledger is only safe if it is
derived automatically and verifiably from the provider — and can detect its own
staleness. Absent that, one authority is better than two.

What the version and hash in `.github/cla-policy.json` are *for*, then, is to
pin **which text** the provider is collecting signatures against. The provider
answers "did this person sign?"; the repository answers "sign what, exactly?".

While no provider is configured — which is the current state, deliberately —
nobody can be recorded as having signed, and the gate blocks every non-exempt
human contributor **with an explanation**. That is the correct behaviour: an
unconfigured service is not consent, and silence is not a signature.

## Rights transfer, if the holder ever changes

If the CLA is accepted by an individual rights holder and Tavotto's IP is later
moved to a company — on incorporation, or as part of financing — the rights
received under the CLA do not travel automatically. A future transfer would need
to cover, at minimum:

- copyright in Tavotto's own code;
- the trademark rights described in [`TRADEMARKS.md`](../../TRADEMARKS.md);
- the right to grant commercial licences;
- **the contractual rights received under signed CLAs** — these are contracts
  with each contributor, and Section 6.3 of both agreements requires an assignee
  to agree in writing to abide by the agreement's rights and obligations;
- any applicable patent rights.

This repository deliberately does **not** contain an IP assignment agreement or
attempt to draft one. This is corporate-formation and financing legal work, and
it requires legal review at the time. It is recorded here only so that the CLA's
existence is not forgotten during such a transaction.

## Version history

| Version | Status | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `1.0-draft` | Superseded by `1.0` | 2026-08-27 | Initial text. Harmony 1.0, CLA form, Option Five. Held at draft while `RIGHTS_HOLDER_CONFIGURATION_REQUIRED` was unresolved. **No signature was ever collected against it**, so nothing had to migrate. |
| **`1.0`** | **Current — signable** | 2026-08-28 | `RIGHTS_HOLDER_CONFIGURATION_REQUIRED` resolved: counterparty is **Jiaqi Wan**, a natural person; governing law is the **Hong Kong SAR**; correspondence to `support@tavotto.com`. Counterparty and governing law are material fields, so this is a new version rather than an edit to the draft. Operative text otherwise byte-identical to `1.0-draft`. **This is the first published version** — `1.0-draft` never left the branch it was written on, and no signature was ever collected against it. |

A provider may now be marked as configured (the structural bar on draft versions
no longer applies), but none is configured yet — see
[CLA_AUTOMATION_SETUP.md](CLA_AUTOMATION_SETUP.md).
